# ImagesDecoder-Unity
This is a little project that contains some code to read and process the image that is obtained as an encoded string from any source, especially from a passport chip. This project contains the next three classes: **ImagesDecoder**, **ImageJpeg2000Info**, and **Image**. This classes are needed for the proper functioning of the NFC scan module (https://github.com/nailuj1992/unity_nfc).
